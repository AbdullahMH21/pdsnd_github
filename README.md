### Project Title
Bikeshare Data Analysis Tool

### Description
This project is a command-line Python tool that provides data analysis for bike-sharing systems in three major U.S. cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington. Users can filter data by city, month, and day to explore various statistics, such as popular travel times, commonly used stations, trip durations, and user demographics. It uses data provided in CSV files and relies on the Pandas library to process and analyze the information based on user-specified filters. It also allows users to view raw data in increments of 5 rows upon request.

### Files used
- `chicago.csv`: Contains bikeshare data for Chicago.
- `new_york_city.csv`: Contains bikeshare data for New York City.
- `washington.csv`: Contains bikeshare data for Washington.
- `bikeshare.py`: Main Python script that performs data loading, filtering, and statistical analysis.

### Credits
This project is part of the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree program. Special thanks to Udacity for providing the initial dataset and project framework. Additional resources and inspiration were taken from the Pandas documentation and Stack Overflow.
